function [level, em] = graythreshFast(I)
%GRAYTHRESH Global image threshold using Otsu's method.
%   LEVEL = GRAYTHRESH(I) computes a global threshold (LEVEL) that can be
%   used to convert an intensity image to a binary image with IMBINARIZE.
%   LEVEL is a normalized intensity value that lies in the range [0, 1].
%   GRAYTHRESH uses Otsu's method, which chooses the threshold to minimize
%   the intraclass variance of the thresholded black and white pixels.
%
%   [LEVEL, EM] = GRAYTHRESH(I) returns effectiveness metric, EM, as the
%   second output argument. It indicates the effectiveness of thresholding
%   of the input image and it is in the range [0, 1]. The lower bound is
%   attainable only by images having a single gray level, and the upper
%   bound is attainable only by two-valued images.
%
%   Class Support
%   -------------
%   The input image I can be uint8, uint16, int16, single, or double, and it
%   must be nonsparse.  LEVEL and EM are double scalars. 
%
%   Example
%   -------
%       I = imread('coins.png');
%       level = graythresh(I);
%       BW = imbinarize(I,level);
%       figure, imshow(BW)
